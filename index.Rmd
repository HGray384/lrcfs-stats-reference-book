# Preface {-}

This book provides a learning resource for judges on the topic of  evaluating forensic science evidence using probability and statistics. High quality resources on this topic, authored by pioneers of methodology to evaluate forensic scientific evidence, do already exist. These include @aitken2010, @puch2012, @roberts2014, @jackson2015, @icca2017, @primer2020. This resource aims to complement and extend the existing texts in the following ways:

1. by providing interactive material and worked exercises to enhance the learning experience

2. by being based online to allow feedback to be easily given and regularly actioned upon, and content updated as current practices change and scientific thinking continues

3. to develop an understanding of judicial needs and attitudes in order to tailor current and future content
