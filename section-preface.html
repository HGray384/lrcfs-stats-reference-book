<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This book produced by the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science provides a learning and reference resource for those without statistical expertise on the topic of evaluating forensic science evidence using the likelihood ratio approach. It aims to provide the stepping stones required to become comfortable with likelihood ratio-based evaluations of evidence, as endorsed by the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes, and the Forensic Science Regulator of the UK.</p>

<div id="section-why-this-book" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Why this book</h2>
<p>High quality resources can already be found on this topic, which have been authored by the founders of systematic approaches to forensic evidence evaluation and which have been endorsed by national-level organisations. These include <span class="citation">Aitken, Roberts, and Jackson (<a href="#section-ref-aitken2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Puch-Solis et al. (<a href="#section-ref-puch2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Roberts and Aitken (<a href="#section-ref-roberts2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Jackson, Aitken, and Roberts (<a href="#section-ref-jackson2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">ICCA (<a href="#section-ref-icca2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Royal Society (<a href="#section-ref-statsprimer2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. This resource aims to complement and extend the existing texts in the following ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>by providing more examples for each of the core concepts so that learners can see the theory in action</p></li>
<li><p>by providing worked exercises and solutions for learners to test and reinforce their understanding</p></li>
<li><p>by providing interactive material (in the online version of this resource) to enhance the learning experience</p></li>
<li><p>by being based online to allow feedback to be easily given and regularly implemented, and for content updates to be easily made as scientific thinking develops and current practices change - see the sections below on how to contribute.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This book follows the main content from the Royal Statistical Society’s Fundamentals of Probability and Statistical Evidence in Criminal Proceedings book <span class="citation">(Aitken, Roberts, and Jackson <a href="#section-ref-aitken2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> and then portions of The Logic of Forensic Proof <span class="citation">(Roberts and Aitken <a href="#section-ref-roberts2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. We have also provided motivation for the use of probability and statistics by drawing from the uncertainty communication literature, and in particular adapting the advocated model from <span class="citation">Bles et al. (<a href="#section-ref-vanderbles2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> to forensic science. Put together, this resource provides an intermediate overview of why and how we use probability and the likelihood ratio for evaluating forensic evidence, including examples and exercises to reinforce understanding.</p>
<p>This book can be used to supplement the online course content from [cite MOOC]. This way, learners can progress through more formal training (with video, audio, and graded tests), and simply use this book as a resource to see further examples. The order and presentation of the material is different to what appears in the course, although most of the same ideas appear here.</p>
<p>The interactive examples in the online version of this book can be found as part of an interactive application found <a href="https://lrcfs.dundee.ac.uk/apps/interactive-lr/">here</a>. This is to provide a standalone resource for those who are not using the book e.g. a wider audience, and also so that those who prefer to use a printed version of this book can still have fast access to the examples they need.</p>
<p>The content presented here is not a comprehensive guide to the evaluation of all forensic evidence. For example in the UK (as of writing this in August 2020), the numerical evaluation of impression evidence (such as fingerprints) is not widely practised compared to say, how it is done in other jurisdictions such as The Netherlands. In addition, each evidence type is currently at a different stage of scientific understanding. As a result, the exact statistical considerations for each evidence type differ, even if the general evaluation methodology is similar. More information on the state of each type of evidence can be found in the judicial Primers series commissioned by the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Edinburgh <span class="citation">(Royal Society <a href="#section-ref-dnaprimer2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#section-ref-dnaprimer2017" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>, <a href="#section-ref-gaitprimer2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a><a href="#section-ref-gaitprimer2017" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>, <a href="#section-ref-statsprimer2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="section-who-this-is-for" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Who this is for</h2>
<p>This book is primarily aimed at judges, but in the UK that covers at least two distinct domains: criminal and civil. The skills required to understand the statistical evidence in both of these domains is sufficiently different to be given separate treatments. This book (as of the current version) is dominated by content to help with forensic evidence in criminal cases. As time progresses and we receive feedback, and in particular if there is demand for it, we may add content to aid understanding of civil applications of statistics too, e.g. epidemiological evidence.</p>
<p>There is a wider audience who might also benefit from this material. This includes legal counsel, students of law, and students of forensic science who are relatively new to statistics and its application in evaluating evidence. Our hope is that this can be an engaging resource to supplement professional development and formal study.</p>
<p>We welcome feedback and contributions so that we can improve the content of this book. See the notes on how to contribute and and how to contact us in the sections below.</p>

<div id="section-how-to-contribute" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>One of the purposes of this book is to be reactive to feedback and be easy to contribute to. We strongly encourage feedback, be it negative or positive, so that we can change what is not working and keep what is working and ensure the book remains fit for purpose. Collaboration from all stakeholders within the criminal justice system is welcomed.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<div id="section-funders" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Funders</h3>
<p>Harry is funded by the David and Claudia Harding foundation on grant [enter grant number], and is a postdoctoral research assistant at LRCFS which is funded by the Leverhulme Trust. Thanks go to these funding bodies, who have made this non-traditional academic output possible. It is our intention that this resource will contribute to raising statistical and probabilistic literacy within forensic science by embracing emerging technology and positively disrupting the traditional way we engage others with statistical ideas.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-contributors" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Contributors</h3>
<p>Roy Mudie at LRCFS has helped to develop the R Shiny application which accompanies this book. This allows the html version of this book to contain interactive examples which we hope (and soon will test to see!) enhance the users’ learning experience. The application can also be used as a standalone tool to engage with other statistical content. Roy has helped with many of the technical issues which have arisen behind the scenes and has helped to visualise some of our examples in a way that is intuitive. Thanks a lot for all of your work, Roy!</p>
<p>A big thanks goes to Pat Dugard, Pauline Mack, Joyce Klu, Heather Doran, Emma Comrie, Lucina Hackman, and Niamh Nic Daéid as members of an internal review team at LRCFS. This team provided feedback on the content and appearance of the book which has significantly improved its presentation, conciseness, and clarity.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>This book was written using the <strong>bookdown</strong> package <span class="citation">(Xie <a href="#section-ref-R-bookdown" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, which was built on top of R Markdown and <strong>knitr</strong> <span class="citation">(Xie <a href="#section-ref-xie2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. This fantastic free and well-documented software has allowed this book to be developed hassle-free in a completely reproducible way.
