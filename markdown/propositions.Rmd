# Propositions for facts-in-issue {#propositions}

This Chapter introduces propositions

## Facts-in-issue

To motivate the use of propositions, we begin with a discussion about facts-in-issue. Facts-in-issue are the relevant facts of a specific case which are contested by each side of the legal dispute. In criminal trials, this typically manifests as the defence contesting facts which the prosecution have asserted.

There is epistemic uncertainty about the facts-in-issue and so relevant evidence is presented to the court. The fact finder then considers this evidence to determine the truth of the facts-in-issue, and ultimately the outcome of the case. 

It is clear from this that the language and presentation of facts-in-issue must be precise and accurate. The presentation should also be done in a way that allows the fact finder to clearly discriminate between what either side of counsel is asserting. To achieve this, forensic scientists formalise the facts-in-issue into what are known as propositions. 

## Propositions

A proposition is an assertion about a factual state of nature. The 'factual' part of that is key since it means that the assertion is capable of being either true or false. Thus, propositions are capable of either being true or false. Although not always correct, we will speak of propositions as not only **capable of being** either true or false, but **as** being either true or false. 

The truth of propositions does not depend upon people's belief about them (unless the proposition is specifically about their belief). Consider the following:

1. The Earth orbits the Sun.
2. The Earth is flat.

Proposition 1 is true and proposition 2 is false, and we have substantial scientific evidence to prove this. At a certain point of time in history, however, common belief about those propositions was false: people thought that the Sun orbited the Earth, and that the Earth was flat (and some still do...). It was true that the Earth orbits the Sun both before and after humans had enough evidence to believe it was true. 

Propositions can still evoke epistemic uncertainty; they are true or false but we might not know which. In this case we can probabilistically reason about them. Consider another example:

3. Poker Player B is holding an ace in this round.

In this hypothetical poker game, it's self-evident that the proposition is true if Player B is holding an ace and it is false if Player B is not holding an ace. If you are Player B then you will know the truth of this and the proposition is trivial. However, if you are not Player B then you won't know the truth of this; you have epistemic uncertainty.

To play your hand well, you will have to come to a reasonable belief about the probability of this proposition (and others) and make decisions about checking, raising, or folding etc., whilst accounting for this uncertainty. Note that in this example you might **never** know the truth of this proposition. Player B might never turn over their cards nor reveal the answer. The proposition was still either true or false regardless of this.

The truth of some propositions may change as situations change. Consider the following:

4. Boris Johnson's Conservative party govern the UK. 

As of me writing this, the proposition is true. The UK still exists, the Conservative party exist under that same name and are led by Boris Johnson, and his party governs the UK after a landslide general election win. This proposition won't be true forever, and may not even be true by the time you're reading this. It can help to be more specific when formulating propositions to overcome this dependence on time or other factors. Changing the proposition instead to:

5. On 20th May 2020, Boris Johnson's Conservative party govern the UK 

gives a more specific proposition that is now unambigious about the temporal factor which may affect it. However, the proposition is now less general since it only refers to one specific day. Whether this lack of generality is worth the extra specificity or not depends on the question at hand. When the question is provided by investigators and given to forensic scientists, then the scientists have to balance these factors when formulating appropriate propositions. 

## Competing propositions

When formulating propositions from facts-in-issue, the different sides of the adversarial system make different assertions about the circumstances which lead to the same factual observation. Translating these assertions into propositions gives so-called competing propositions. Competing propositions typically come in pairs, one put forward by each side of legal counsel.

Case scenario: Police were called to the house of a known local drug-dealer after reports by neighbours of a suspected gunshot heard from within. They arrived at the scene to find a middle-aged male, the owner of the house and the drug-dealer, shot dead in a bedroom. A window at the back of the house on the ground floor was found to be smashed, with the glass having fallen towards the inside of the house. They found open death-threats on the deceased's public social media account from two males. The males are known to police, having previously been involved in drug-related crimes too. Both are arrested their known addresses, at which time Suspect 1 confesses to having broken in to the house but not having fired the weapon. He refuses to name any accomplices. Suspect 2 refuses to comment, despite glass-covered clothing being found within a plastic bag in his waste disposal unit. After further testing, this clothing was also found to be covered in gunshot-residue particles. No weapon is recovered.

Here are three facts-in-issue of the (probably) many for this case at this preliminary stage. 

Fact-in-issue: whether or not Suspect 2 (or 1) killed the victim with the intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.

6. P: Suspect 2 (or 1) committed murder,
7. D: Suspect 2 (or 1 or both) did not commit murder,

Fact-in-issue: whether or not Suspect 2 fired the gun in question

8. P: Suspect 2 fired the gun,
9. D: Suspect 2 did not fire the gun,

Fact-in-issue: whether or not the glass fragments found on Suspect 2's clothing originated from the smashed window

10. P: The glass fragments originate from the smashed window,
11. D: The glass fragments originate from a source other than the smashed window.
