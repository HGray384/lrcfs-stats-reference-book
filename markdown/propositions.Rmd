This Chapter introduces propositions

## Facts-in-issue

To motivate the use of propositions, we begin with a discussion about facts-in-issue. Facts-in-issue are the relevant facts of a specific case which are contested by each side of the legal dispute. In criminal trials, this typically manifests as the defence contesting facts which the prosecution have asserted.

There is epistemic uncertainty about the facts-in-issue and so relevant evidence is presented to the court. The fact finder then considers this evidence to determine the truth of the facts-in-issue, and ultimately the outcome of the case. 

It is clear from this that the language and presentation of facts-in-issue must be precise and accurate. The presentation should also be done in a way that allows the fact finder to clearly discriminate between what either side of counsel is asserting. To achieve this, forensic scientists formalise the facts-in-issue into what are known as propositions.
