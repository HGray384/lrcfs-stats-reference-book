Benjamin Franklin wrote this in 1789 in the context of the newly formed US constitution. He also concisely and inadvertantly summarised the central idea behind what came to be known as probability and statistical theory.

The word uncertainty is used by many people in different contexts with a variety of intended meanings. It's useful to discuss what we mean by uncertainty, provide some examples of situations in which it is useful to think about and communicate uncertainty, and to show how it motivates the work behind evaluating forensic scientific evidence. That's what we'll do in this Chapter.

## The impact of uncertainty

Uncertainty describes a situation in which we do not know something. Since we cannot know everything, uncertainty is unavoidable. 

Experiencing something positive and uncertain can leave us feeling exhilarated. We have all been surprised by something nice: an unexpected present, the unanticipated appearance of a loved one, taking a chance and being lucky. Uncertainty can make life more exciting.

But for many of us, uncertainty is also uncomfortable: having job insecurity, being unsure about the health of a loved one, not understanding the effects of climate change. These are saddening, stressful, and confusing circumstances. Some of this negativity has its roots in uncertainty about the cause and/or possible outcomes of the situation.

Managing and communicating uncertainty can help to mitigate possible negative consequences. The communication part is key to forming expectations and adjusting existing expectations to be more realistic. However, in many aspects of life today, uncertainty is simply ignored or it is deliberately hidden from those who can benefit from knowing it. 

Some of us are still surprised when we hear about medical diagnostic test results being wrong, politicians being certain promises can be delivered only for them to fall short to an embarrassing degree, imprisoned individuals being exonerated after overly certain expert testimony comes to light. Generally, we don't handle uncertainty very well. In order to start handling uncertainty better, we start here by making a distinction between different types of uncertainty.

## Types of uncertainty

Uncertainty in its broad definition from the previous section covers a spectrum of situations. Some of these situations can seem fundamentally different based upon the type of uncertainty they express. We focus on two types of uncertainty

1. **Aleatory uncertainty**: uncertainty due to variation. 
2. **Epistemic uncertainty**: uncertainty due to ignorance.

**Aleatory uncertainty** concerns situations with natural variability, sometimes referred to as **chance**. With this type of uncertainty, we cannot be certain about something because there is a component of randomness to it. By way of example, before I spin a roulette wheel, I ask you what number the ball will land on. Due to the randomness involved in the spin, you cannot know the outcome and so your guess will be uncertain. We cannot reduce this uncertainty because it is inherent in the process that causes it.

**Epistemic uncertainty** concerns situations about which we have a lack of knowledge. The reason for this type of uncertainty is that we do not know all of the necessary information. Suppose I ask you to turn your back so that you do not see the result of the roulette spin. I spin the wheel and see the result, and then I ask you to guess the number. Your guess is now uncertain not because of randomness, but because you do not have the information that I have. There is no uncertainty for me but there is for you, and your uncertainty can be eliminated by learning what I know. We can reduce this uncertainty by obtaining more information.

This idea of personal uncertainty is key when thinking about events which have happened in the past. It is clearly true that past events have either occurred or not. Some people hold the belief that there cannot be uncertainty about past events because of this. An alternative perspective is to consider uncertainty as being personal to an individual. Instead of asking "uncertainty about what?", ask "uncertainty to whom about what?" If uncertainty is personal, then anyone who does not have much information about a past event can have a reasonable amount of uncertainty about its truth.

This uncertainty is reflected in the phrase 'beyond reasonable doubt', the burden of proof for the prosecution in UK criminal trials. It is not 'without any doubt'; there is room for some uncertainty. Events have happened but maybe only the aggrieved and the defendant are certain about the truth. The fact finder begins a trial with a high degree of uncertainty about events, with the presumption of innocence on behalf of the defendant. Evidence which shines light on the truth is presented to the fact finder in an attempt to reduce this epistemic uncertainty about events. Upon hearing all the evidence, the fact finder makes a decision as to whether the prosecution sufficiently reduced their uncertainty to 'beyond reasonable doubt' in favour of guilt. 

Uncertainty is present in all parts of the legal system as it is in every other aspect of society. Now that we have discussed the types of uncertainty, we can focus on the topic of this book: uncertainty in scientific evidence.

## Uncertainty in scientific evidence

There are multiple sources of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty in forensic scientific evidence. The reliability in the underlying science and the application of the science varies across the different scientific evidence types. This means that the uncertainties will be different depending on the type of evidence in question. In this section, we will consider evidence in general and the collective uncertainties that can be present. Then we work through a small example using a specific instance of fibre evidence.

We will consider the following questions when thinking about uncertainty in forensic scientific evidence:

1. What are we uncertain about? 
2. What are the sources of uncertainty? 
3. What is the level of our uncertainty? 
4. What is the magnitude of uncertainty? 
5. In what form is the uncertainty communicated? 

Let's take a look at each of these in the order that they appear above.

**What are we uncertain about?** This is the **object** of uncertainty. This is most often the sequence of events which led to the evidence. Nested within this, there can also be uncertainties about the characteristics of the evidence, the analysis of the evidence, comparisons of the evidence to information within databases, expert opinion concerning the evidence, etc.

**What are the sources of uncertainty?** These are the **reasons** for uncertainty. Imprecise measurements, contaminated evidence, lack of scientific knowledge, database limitations, subjective interpretation, etc.

**What is the level of our uncertainty?** This is whether each uncertainty relates **directly** to the object itself or **indirectly** through uncertainties about things which affect the object. For example, uncertainty about the item of evidence or lack of confidence in the science underlying the evidence interpretation.

**What is the magnitude of uncertainty?** This is **how** uncertain we are. Does the measurement technology have a high or low level of precision? Is the database highly reliable or not? Is the expert's interpretation generally reasonable or is it radical? How well does the evidence support the prosecution?

**In what form is the uncertainty communicated?** What tools are used to **communicate** the uncertainty to others. Is uncertainty mentioned in the expert report? Is it clear that they have been addressed or are they only acknowledged? Has a number been used to convey the uncertainty, or a verbal expression?

Let's think about an example of fibre evidence found at a crime scene. In this case we'll assume that fibres matching clothing of the suspect were recovered at the scene. The main uncertainty might be whether or not the suspect committed the crime. This is epistemic uncertainty: the suspect either did or did not commit the crime but we don't know which is true. The fibre evidence alone might not completely reduce this uncertainty, but it could reduce it somewhat by reducing uncertainty about whether or not the suspect was at the crime scene at a relevant time. 

The expert who interprets the fibre evidence addresses uncertainty about the evidence. The fibre evidence is the **object** of uncertainty in this example. The **reasons** for uncertainty about this evidence might relate to how rare this type of fibre is in the general population or how well it transfers from clothing to surfaces and how well it persists on those surfaces. These are **direct** uncertainties about the fibre evidence.

Claims about these direct uncertainties will often be supported by scientific studies, e.g. databases containing the frequency of certain fibres, which may be informed by other recovered clothing of a similar type or population surveys. Uncertainties about the fibre evidence which relate to the reliability of the database in this specific case circumstance or the underlying survey methodology are **indirect**. 

The expert will synthesise these uncertainties either quantitatively using a mathematical model or qualitatively using their expertise (for which there is more uncertainty about the appropriateness of the mathematical model or the calibration of expert opinion). The result will be a number or a range of possible numbers describing the **magnitude** of a particular uncertainty. For example, the expert might determine that out of every 1000 similar case circumstances they would expect 200 to yield a fibre match if the suspect had truly been at the crime scene. The expert might also determine that out of every 1000 similar case circumstances they would expect only 2 to yield a fibre match if the suspect had truly not been at the crime scene.

It is recommended practice that these magnitudes of uncertainty are combined into a single quantity, known as the likelihood ratio. This quantity is then **communicated** in expert reports. In the fibre example, the expert has determined that it is 100 times more likely that the fibre evidence would have been observed if the suspect had been at the crime scene rather than if they hadn't. All of the content in this book builds up to understanding likelihood ratios, and so circle back to them at the end in Chapter \@ref(likelihood-ratio). 

In the example above, we only focussed on one possible object of uncertainty. In reality, there are dozons of these objects that the expert has to consider and combine when interpreting evidence. The reasons for each of these objects of uncertainty will be case dependent and most often complicated by the complicated nature of criminal activities. This makes assessing uncertainty challenging. The expert might reasonably ignore some uncertainties to make this task more feasible.

In addition, the 'science' part of forensic science is still a developing field. Expert interpretations which historically overlooked (and in some cases ignored) major elements of uncertainty in their discipline are gradually being updated by practices which are informed by scientific evidence. But have no illusion, there is still a long way to go. There is still a large amount of epistemic uncertainty. Notwithstanding this, there will always be a degree of aleatoric uncertainty due to the probabilistic nature of real-world processes, e.g. transference of materials from direct contact with surfaces (and many others). One result of this at (pre-)trial is that there might always be reasonable disagreement between experts. These disagreements can still be settled in the mind of the fact finder in the same way as disagreements in other aspects of evidence: through cross-examination.

Uncertainty in both of its forms is (and will always be) an integral part of scientific evidence. This means that it is important for us as a community to work together to ensure a common understanding of uncertainty, both in terms of how we think about it and how we talk about it. A lot of research thus far has focussed on how we should think about uncertainty. There is still more work to be done on talking about uncertainty in scientific evidence, and in this respect forensic science is similar to other scientific communities who wish to convey their results to non-experts. This brings us on to the final section of this chapter.

## Communicating uncertainty is hard

Despite uncertainty being everywhere, the communication surrounding it (particularly by experts) is often not well done. One reason for this is because communicating uncertainty is hard. We'll take a look at some of the components that make it so hard.

- It is hard to explain the exact meaning of uncertainty. It often deals with thinking about hypothetical events in the future or past and considering hypothetical or real outcomes of those hypothetical events. This requires creativity and experience to get right, and even then it's easy to make mistakes. As explained before, the word uncertainty means different things to people in the first place.

- It is hard to explain uncertainty in a way that is understood by the recipient. People have different preferences for different information formats. I have taken a more visual approach to formats in this text and that will work for some but not others. Understanding and switching between quantitative forms of uncertainty also requires a fairly high level of numeracy. I have used a validated approach to this that has been shown to be generally more understandable but will not work for everyone. I also have no idea how well each of you understood it, so please do send feedback.

- It is hard to know which uncertainties to communicate, and which to spare the detail of. The uncertainties need to be relevant to the receiver but at the same time not overlook important detail. 

- It feels hard to communicate uncertainty when the receiver trusts you. There is a perception among experts that expressing uncertainty diminishes trust and reliability. Fortunately, there is growing evidence to suggest that the opposite is true when communication is done well. 

- It is hard to communicate uncertainty when you know the receiver has to use your uncertain information to make an important decision and may want a definite answer.

It is important to mention these reasons because there may be times when you read through the following material and don't understand something. Or, maybe you understand it quite well but hear an expert not explaining it well. It is a learned skill and it is hard, but it improves with practice.

The aim of the rest of this book is to give some insight into the way uncertainty is handled in forensic science. We've deviated somewhat from the normal ways that it is communicated in the hope of receiving feedback about how this new medium is working from our target audience. Using this feedback, we are gathering evidence to contribute towards evidence-based communication methods of uncertainty in forensic science. 

Looking to the next section we will introduce a common language for describing uncertainty, probability.
