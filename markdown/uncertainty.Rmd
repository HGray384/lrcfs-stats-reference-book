> "... in this world there is nothing certain but death and taxes."

> --- Benjamin Franklin

Benjamin Franklin wrote this in 1789 in the context of the newly formed US constitution. He also concisely and inadvertantly summarised the central idea behind what came to be known as probability and statistical theory.

The word uncertainty is used by many people in different contexts with a variety of intended meanings. It's useful to discuss what we mean by uncertainty, provide some examples of situations in which it is useful to think about and communicate uncertainty, and to show how it motivates the work behind evaluating forensic scientific evidence. That's what we'll do in this Chapter.

## Uncertainty is everywhere

> Uncertainty: a situation in which something is not known, or something that is not known or certain.

> --- Cambridge Dictionary

Will it be sunny at the weekend? Will the England women's team win the next football World Cup? How about the men? Will my favourite sandwich shop have my favourite bread tomorrow? By how many degrees will the Earth's temperature rise by 2050? All of these questions involve thinking about different uncertainties about the future.

When did dinosaurs become extinct? What did I eat for breakfast on this day 20 years ago? Who was Jack the Ripper? Is the defendant innocent or guilty? All of these questions involve thinking about different uncertainties about the past. Past events have either occurred or not, but we can still be uncertain about them (as with the identity of Jack the Ripper). 



Attitudes towards uncertainty


We will consider two types of uncertainty:

1. Aleatory uncertainty: uncertainty due to variation,
2. Epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty due to ignorance.

**Aleatory uncertainty** concerns situations with natural variability, sometimes referred to as **chance**. What number will win on the next spin of a roulette wheel? 

**Epistemic uncertainty** concerns situations about which we have a lack of knowledge. 

## Uncertainty in scientific evidence

What are the sources of uncertainty?

What is the level of our uncertainty?

What is the magnitude of uncertainty?

In what form is that uncertainty communicated?
